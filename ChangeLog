---------- -----------  -------------------------------------------------------
[Version 0.3.3 released - 11.11.2004]==========================================
2004-09-11 patrickh     Fixed the build on Mac OS X.

[Version 0.3.2 released - 4.11.2004]===========================================
2004-04-11 patrickh     The library binaries each have unique names on Win32.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.3.2

[Version 0.3.1 released - 3.5.2004]============================================
2004-03-05 aronb        Work around a debug/optimized binary incompatibility
                        within cppdom::Node.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.3.1

[Version 0.3.0 released - 1.28.2004]===========================================
2004-01-28 patrickh     Restored the ability to compile shared libraries.
2003-10-07 allenb       Added support for "stringification" of attrib text and
                        cdata text.  This makes the system automatically
                        escape any tokens (&<>"') before saving and upon load.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.1
2003-02-20 allenb       Added isEqual method to Node interface.
                        Created test application to test combinations of
                        isEqual comparisons.
2003-02-07 nonchocoboy  Replaced Doozer-based build system with an SCons-based
                        build system.
2003-01-14 allenb       Added debug name member to the Node class.  This member
                        stores the string rep of the Node name but only
                        if CPPDOM_DEBUG is defined.  This member can REALLY
                        help when looking at cppdom code in a debugger.
2003-01-11 allenb       Refactoring exception class.
                        cppdom::Error now tracks a local description of the
                        error as well as the file and line number that the error
                        occured on.  There is a new macro that helps to
                        construct the Error class to throw.
                        Also fixed the attribute API to throw an exception when
                        passed an invalid attribute name.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.2.0
2003-01-11 allenb       Change NodeList type to std::vector instead of std::list
2003-01-11 allenb       Added flags for disabling indentation and/or newlines
                        in node and document saving.
2003-01-11 allenb       Added a simplified interface to cdata.  This new
                        interface allows basic cdata manipulation from the
                        parent element of the actual cdata node.
2003-01-10 allenb       Added an example that makes a tree from scratch.
                        Added node and doc constructors that take the name
                        of the new node.
2003-01-06 allenb       Added general project documentation in the form of
                        .dox files in the doc/dox directory.  Modified doxy
                        config file to parse these files for documentation.
2003-01-03 nonchocoboy  Removed the XML prefix on the class names.
2003-01-02 nonchocoboy  Brought the VC7 build up to date.
                        NEW VERSON: 0.1.0
2003-01-02 nonchocoboy  Moved implementation code out of the headers to make
                        building as a shared library easier.
2003-01-02 nonchocoboy  Removed xml_char_type and XMLString typedefs.
2002-12-02 nonchocoboy  Specialization of XMLAttribute::getValue<T> for
                        std::string added so that more than the first word of
                        the attribute string can be retrieved.
2002-12-02 nonchocoboy  Added versioning information.
                        NEW VERSION: 0.0.1
2002-05-06 subatomic    Added README and build instructions
2002-05-05 subatomic    Brought the code up to coding standard (API changed!).
2002-05-05 subatomic    Added build system based on Doozer gnumake tools
                        support irix, linux, solaris, freebsd, win32 under
                        cygwin, probably other too but untested see README.
2002-05-05 allenb       Added save_file method for document node.
2002-05-01 subatomic    Added predicate.h, and two predicates
2002-04-05 allenb       Fix EOF and -1 chars on Irix.
2002-04-03 allenb       Added Node::getChild(char*) to avoid matching templated
                        predicate version.
2002-02-19 allenb       cppdom_boost::shared_ptr (no conflict with real boost)
2002-02-09 subatomic    const correctness, coding style
2002-02-08 subatomic    branched cppdom from 0.6 LGPL version of xmlpp
